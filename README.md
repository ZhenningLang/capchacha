# CaptchaCha

CaptchaCha is a lightweight captcha generation library, 
which is originally forked from 
[wheezy.captcha](https://github.com/ContextLogic/wheezy-captcha)

## What is it?

Use it to generate captcha to defend your website,
or to get some train data for Finetuning.

## Install & Usage

Check source codes directly for usage, because this project is so toy.

Especially check src/test.py, which is a simple example.

## Notice

For easier understanding, 
I deliberately removed all uncompleted files (http, etc) 
, distributed related files and py2/py3 compatibility files 
compared with the original repository
to keep this project as simple as possible

And also, I added some comments in Chinese in the source code.
